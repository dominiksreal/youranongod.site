    <p style="color:black">Anonymous is a decentralized international activist and hacktivist collective and movement primarily known for its various cyberattacks against several governments, government institutions and government agencies, corporations and the Church of Scientology.</p>
    <p style="color:black">Anonymous originated in 2003 on the imageboard 4chan representing the concept of many online and offline community users simultaneously existing as an "anarchic", digitized "global brain" or "hivemind".</p>
    <p style="color:black">Anonymous members (known as anons) can sometimes be distinguished in public by the wearing of Guy Fawkes masks in the style portrayed in the graphic novel and film V for Vendetta.</p>
    <p style="color:black">Some anons also opt to mask their voices through voice changers or text-to-speech programs.</p>
    <p style="color:black">Dozens of people have been arrested for involvement in Anonymous cyberattacks in countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, the Netherlands, Spain, India, and Turkey.</p>
    <p style="color:black">Evaluations of the group's actions and effectiveness vary widely. Supporters have called the group "freedom fighters" and digital Robin Hoods, while critics have described them as "a cyber lynch-mob" or "cyber terrorists".</p>
    <p style="color:black">In 2012, Time called Anonymous one of the "100 most influential people" in the world.Anonymous' media profile diminished by 2018,but the group re-emerged in 2020 to support the George Floyd protests and other causes.</p>
    <h1 style="text-align;font-size:25px;color:black"><li>Philosophy</li></h1>
    <p style="color:black">Long-standing political question that has gone unanswered with often tragic consequences for social movements. This is an Internet-based, non-extremist, socialist community movement that looks for answers to questions that are unanswered.</p>
    <p style="color:black">Internal dissent is also a regular feature of the group. A website associated with the group describes it as "an Internet gathering" with "a very loose and decentralized command structure that operates on ideas rather than directives". Gabriella Coleman writes of the group: "In some ways, it may be impossible to gauge the intent and motive of thousands of participants, many of who don't even bother to leave a trace of their thoughts, motivations, and reactions. Among those that do, opinions vary considerably."</p>
    <p style="color:black">Broadly speaking, Anons oppose Internet censorship and control and the majority of their actions target governments, organizations, and corporations that they accuse of censorship. Anons were early supporters of the global Occupy movement and the Arab Spring. Since 2008, a frequent subject of disagreement within Anonymous is whether members should focus on pranking and entertainment or more serious (and, in some cases, political) activism.</p>
    <p style="color:black">We [Anonymous] just happen to be a group of people on the Internet who need - just kind of an outlet to do as we wish, that we wouldn't be able to do in regular society. ...That's more or less the point of it. Do as you wish. ... There's a common phrase: 'we are doing it for the lulz.</p>
    <p style="color:black">- Trent Peacock. Search Engine: The Face of Anonymous, February 7, 2008. </p>
    <p style="color:black">Because Anonymous has no leadership, no action can be attributed to the membership as a whole. Parmy Olson and others have criticized media coverage that presents the group as well-organized or homogeneous; Olson writes, "There was no single leader pulling the levers, but a few organizational minds that sometimes pooled together to start planning a stunt." Some members protest using legal means, while others employ illegal measures such as DDoS attacks and hacking. Membership is open to anyone who wishes to state they are a member of the collective; British journalist Carole Cadwalladr of The Observer compared the group's decentralized structure to that of al-Qaeda: "If you believe in Anonymous, and call yourself Anonymous, you are Anonymous." Olson, who formerly described Anonymous as a "brand", stated in 2012 that she now characterized it as a "movement" rather than a group: "anyone can be part of it. It is a crowd of people, a nebulous crowd of people, working together and doing things together for various purposes."</p>
    <p style="color:black">The group's few rules include not disclosing one's identity, not talking about the group, and not attacking media. Members commonly use the tagline "We are Anonymous. We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us." Brian Kelly writes that three of the group's key characteristics are "(1) an unrelenting moral stance on issues and rights, regardless of direct provocation; (2) a physical presence that accompanies online hacking activity; and (3) a distinctive brand."</p>
    <p style="color:black">Journalists have commented that Anonymous' secrecy, fabrications, and media awareness pose an unusual challenge for reporting on the group's actions and motivations. Quinn Norton of Wired writes that: "Anons lie when they have no reason to lie. They weave vast fabrications as a form of performance. Then they tell the truth at unexpected and unfortunate times, sometimes destroying themselves in the process. They are unpredictable." Norton states that the difficulties in reporting on the group cause most writers, including herself, to focus on the "small groups of hackers who stole the limelight from a legion, defied their values, and crashed violently into the law" rather than "Anonymous sea of voices, all experimenting with new ways of being in the world".</p>

    <h1 style="font-size:15px;color:black">4chan raids (2003 to 2007)</h1>
    <p style="color:black">Main article: 4chan</p>
    <p style="color:black">The name Anonymous itself is inspired by the perceived anonymity under which users post images and comments on the Internet. Usage of the term Anonymous in the sense of a shared identity began on imageboards, particularly the /b/ board of 4chan, dedicated to random content and to raiding other websites.</p>
    <p style="color:black">A tag of Anonymous is assigned to visitors who leave comments without identifying the originator of the posted content. Users of imageboards sometimes jokingly acted as if Anonymous was a single individual. The concept of the Anonymous entity advanced in 2004 when an administrator on the 4chan image board activated a "Forced_Anon" protocol that signed all posts as Anonymous.</p>
    <p style="color:black">As the popularity of imageboards increased, the idea of Anonymous as a collective of unnamed individuals became an Internet meme.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p style="color:black">Users of 4chan's /b/ board would occasionally join into mass pranks or raids.</p>
    <p style="color:black">In a raid on July 12, 2006, for example, large numbers of 4chan readers invaded the Finnish social networking site Habbo Hotel with identical avatars; the avatars blocked regular Habbo members from accessing the digital hotel's pool, stating it was "closed due to fail and AIDS".</p>
    <p style="color:black">Future LulzSec member Topiary became involved with the site at this time, inviting large audiences to listen to his prank phone calls via Skype.</p>
    <p style="color:black">Due to the growing traffic on 4chan's board, users soon began to plot pranks off-site using Internet Relay Chat (IRC).</p>
    <p style="color:black">These raids resulted in the first mainstream press story on Anonymous, a report by Fox station KTTV in Los Angeles, California in the U.S. The report called the group "hackers on steroids", "domestic terrorists", and an "Internet hate machine". </p>
    <h1 style="text-align;font-size:25px;color:black"><li>Encyclopedia Dramatica (2004 present)</li></h1>
    <h1 style="font-size:15px;color:black">Main article: Encyclopedia Dramatica</h1>
    <p style="color:black">Encyclopedia Dramatica was founded in 2004 by Sherrod DeGrippo, initially as a means of documenting gossip related to LiveJournal, but it quickly was adopted as a major platform by Anonymous for parody and other purposes.</p>
    <p style="color:black">The not safe for work site celebrates a subversive "trolling culture", and documents Internet memes, culture, and events, such as mass pranks, trolling events, "raids", large-scale failures of Internet security, and criticism of Internet communities that are accused of self-censorship to gain prestige or positive coverage from traditional and established media outlets. Journalist Julian Dibbell described Encyclopedia Dramatica as the site "where the vast parallel universe of Anonymous in-jokes, catchphrases, and obsessions is lovingly annotated, and you will discover an elaborate trolling culture: Flamingly racist and misogynist content lurks throughout, all of it calculated to offend."</p>
    <p style="color:black">The site also played a role in the anti-Scientology campaign of Project Chanology.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p style="color:black">On April 14, 2011, the original URL of the site was redirected to a new website named Oh Internet that bore little resemblance to Encyclopedia Dramatica. Parts of the ED community harshly criticized the changes.</p>
    <p style="color:black">In response, Anonymous launched "Operation Save ED" to rescue and restore the site's content.</p>
    <p style="color:black">The Web Ecology Project made a downloadable archive of former Encyclopedia Dramatica content.</p>
    <p style="color:black">The site's reincarnation was initially hosted at encyclopediadramatica.ch on servers owned by Ryan Cleary, who later was arrested in relation to attacks by LulzSec against Sony.</p>
    <h1 style="text-align;font-size:25px;color:black"><li>Project Chanology (2008)</li></h1>
    <h1 style="font-size:15px;color:black">Main article: Project Chanology</h1>
    <p style="color:black">Anonymous first became associated with hacktivism in 2008 following a series of actions against the Church of Scientology known as Project Chanology.</p>
    <p style="color:black">On January 15, 2008, the gossip blog Gawker posted a video in which celebrity Scientologist Tom Cruise praised the religion; and the Church responded with a cease-and-desist letter for violation of copyright.</p>
    <p style="color:black">4chan users organized a raid against the Church in retaliation, prank-calling its hotline, sending black faxes designed to waste ink cartridges, and launching DDoS attacks against its websites.</p>
    <p style="color:black">The DDoS attacks were at first carried out with the Gigaloader and JMeter applications. Within a few days, these were supplanted by the Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC), a network stress-testing application allowing users to flood a server with TCP or UDP packets.</p>
    <p style="color:black">The LOIC soon became a signature weapon in the Anonymous arsenal; however, it would also lead to a number of arrests of less experienced Anons who failed to conceal their IP addresses.</p>
    <p style="color:black">Some operators in Anonymous IRC channels incorrectly told or lied to new volunteers that using the LOIC carried no legal risk.</p>
    <p style="color:black">During the DDoS attacks, a group of Anons uploaded a YouTube video in which a robotic voice speaks on behalf of Anonymous, telling the "leaders of Scientology" that "For the good of your followers, for the good of mankind for the laughs—we shall expel you from the Internet."</p>
    <p style="color:black">Within ten days, the video had attracted hundreds of thousands of views.</p>
    <p style="color:black">On February 10, thousands of Anonymous joined simultaneous protests at Church of Scientology facilities around the world.</p>
    <p style="color:black">Many protesters wore the stylized Guy Fawkes masks popularized by the graphic novel and film V for Vendetta, in which an anarchist revolutionary battles a totalitarian government; the masks soon became a popular symbol for Anonymous.</p>
    <p style="color:black">In-person protests against the Church continued throughout the year, including "Operation Party Hard" on March 15 and "Operation Reconnect" on April 12.</p>
    <p style="color:black">However, by mid-year, they were drawing far fewer protesters, and many of the organizers in IRC channels had begun to drift away from the project.</p>
    <h1 style="text-align;font-size:25px;color:black"><li>Operation Payback (2010)</li></h1>
    <h1 style="font-size:15px;color:black">Main article: Operation Payback</h1>
    <p style="color:black">By the start of 2009, Scientologists had stopped engaging with protesters and had improved online security, and actions against the group had largely ceased. A period of infighting followed between the politically engaged members (called "moralfags" in the parlance of 4chan) and those seeking to provoke for entertainment (trolls).</p>
    <p style="color:black">By September 2010, the group had received little publicity for a year and faced a corresponding drop in member interest; its raids diminished greatly in size and moved largely off of IRC channels, organizing again from the chan boards, particularly /b/.</p>
    <p style="color:black">In September 2010, however, Anons became aware of Aiplex Software, an Indian software company that contracted with film studios to launch DDoS attacks on websites used by copyright infringers, such as The Pirate Bay.</p>
    <p style="color:black">Coordinating through IRC, Anons launched a DDoS attack on September 17 that shut down Aiplex's website for a day. Primarily using LOIC, the group then targeted the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), successfully bringing down both sites.</p>
    <p style="color:black">On September 19, future LulzSec member Mustafa Al-Bassam (known as "Tflow") and other Anons hacked the website of Copyright Alliance, an anti-infringement group, and posted the name of the operation: "Payback Is A Bitch", or "Operation Payback" for short.</p>
    <p style="color:black">Anons also issued a press release, stating:Anonymous is tired of corporate interests controlling the internet and silencing the people rights to spread information, but more importantly, the right to SHARE with one another. The RIAA and the MPAA feign to aid the artists and their cause; yet they do no such thing. In their eyes is not hope, only dollar signs. Anonymous will not stand this any longer.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p style="color:black">As IRC network operators were beginning to shut down networks involved in DDoS attacks, Anons organized a group of servers to host an independent IRC network, titled AnonOps.</p>
    <p style="color:black">Operation Payback's targets rapidly expanded to include the British law firm ACS:Law, the Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft, the British nightclub Ministry of Sound, the Spanish copyright society Sociedad General de Autores y Editores, the U.S. Copyright Office, and the website of Gene Simmons of Kiss.</p>
    <p style="color:black">By October 7, 2010, total downtime for all websites attacked during Operation Payback was 537.55 hours.</p>
    <p style="color:black">In November 2010, the organization WikiLeaks began releasing hundreds of thousands of leaked U.S. diplomatic cables. In the face of legal threats against the organization by the U.S. government, Amazon.com booted WikiLeaks from its servers, and PayPal, MasterCard, and Visa cut off service to the organization.</p>
    <p style="color:black">Operation Payback then expanded to include "Operation Avenge Assange", and Anons issued a press release declaring PayPal a target.</p>
    <p style="color:black"> Launching DDoS attacks with the LOIC, Anons quickly brought down the websites of the PayPal blog; PostFinance, a Swiss financial company denying service to WikiLeaks; EveryDNS, a web-hosting company that had also denied service; and the website of U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman, who had supported the push to cut off services.</p>
    <p style="color:black">On December 8, Anons launched an attack against PayPal's main site.</p>
    <p style="color:black">According to Topiary, who was in the command channel during the attack, the LOIC proved ineffective, and Anons were forced to rely on the botnets of two hackers for the attack, marshaling hijacked computers for a concentrated assault.</p>
    <p style="color:black">Security researcher Sean-Paul Correll also reported that the "zombie computers" of involuntary botnets had provided 90% of the attack.</p>
    <p style="color:black">Topiary states that he and other Anons then "lied a bit to the press to give it that sense of abundance", exaggerating the role of the grassroots membership. However, this account was disputed.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p style="color:black">The attacks brought down PayPal.com for an hour on December 8 and another brief period on December 9.</p>
    <p style="color:black">Anonymous also disrupted the sites for Visa and MasterCard on December 8.</p>
    <p style="color:black">Anons had announced an intention to bring down Amazon.com as well, but failed to do so, allegedly because of infighting with the hackers who controlled the botnets.</p>
    <p style="color:black">PayPal estimated the damage to have cost the company US$5.5 million. It later provided the IP addresses of 1,000 of its attackers to the FBI, leading to at least 14 arrests.</p>
    <p style="color:black">On Thursday, December 5, 2013, 13 of the PayPal 14 pleaded guilty to taking part in the attacks.</p>
